1. Create a index.html file that imports the React and JSX dependecies, and a main.js file.

2. Run a local http.server with `python3 -m http.server` on that folder's directory. (This will run on port 8000)

3. Write your code (components) in you main.js file

(note that React apps are not usually like this)
