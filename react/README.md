[https://reactjs.org/ React] is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its simple core concepts make the library a useful base for building applications for a variety of platforms, including both web and mobile interfaces. Its popularity and widespread adoption have resulted in a large community that has produced libraries and plugins that make working with React a pleasure.

== Learning Objectives ==
* JSX
* Components and props
* State
* Lifecycle of a component
* Handling events
* Conditional rendering
* Lists and keys
* Forms
* Lifting state up
* Composition vs Inheritance

== Reading Assignments ==
* Read "Thinking in React"
* Read React docs

== Exercises ==

=== Individual assignment:  Todo List in React ===
This is intended to show familiarity and comfort with the basic ideas of building an interactive application with React. It corresponds to the (very similar) Javascript assignment, allowing the apprentices to compare and contrast building applications with pure Javascript and React.

After the allotted time, I gave a walkthrough session in which I built a reference implementation live in front of them, to help them think about the problem in new ways and ask questions in a group setting.

==== Purpose ====
Demonstrate understanding of the following concepts:
* JSX
* Event handling
* Component decomposition
* Managing simple application state with React

==== Method ====
Exercise:  Uses same basic instructions as Todo List (Javascript): https://gitee.unigroupinc.com/qtp2018/todo-js

==== Timeframe ====
About one day.

==== Notes ====
This is intended to show familiarity and comfort with the basic ideas of building an interactive application with React, and to allow the apprentices to compare and contrast building the same application with pure Javascript and the React library.

After the allotted time, I gave a walkthrough session in which I built a reference implementation live in front of them, to help them think about the problem in new ways and ask questions in a group setting.

=== Other assignment ideas ===
* Simple counter (increment and decrement a number)
* React TV
* Calendar
* Pick a user interface to build
