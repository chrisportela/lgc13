<h1>Static Website projects</h1>

<!-- Technology welcome message -->
I learned the main Web Development concepts during high school and college, where I created some simple static web pages with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. This was part of my first direct contact with development, which highly influenced my interest in computer science. I really enjoy being able to create simple, minimal, and efficient websites.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/lgc13/LucasCosta_portfolio/tree/master/static_websites/Corazon_project">1- Corazon Dancers project</a></h2>

<!-- Project BIO -->
This is a static website that I created for a Salsa group that I was a member of while at FSU - Corazon Salsa Dancers. This website aims to show information about the group, such as their purpose, history, and contact information. Someone going on this website should also be able to see pictures, upcoming events, and information on how to join.

This application displays some of my skills with:

- Bootstrap features
- JavaScript
- Carousel Slideshow
- CSS classes and IDs
- HTML development

<!-- Code explanation -->
Bootstrap has a lot of nifty features, such a the grid system that allows me to organize my website with rows and columns within Divs. Another nice thing is the "carousel". Using some of their CSS and JS, I am able to easily create an ongoing carousel slideshow which displays any pictures and text that I input.

<!-- Code snippet -->
You can see that in this code snippet:

```html

<div id="myCarousel" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
  <!-- Indicators -->
  <ol class="carousel-indicators">
    <li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li>
    <li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="1"></li>
    <li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="2"></li>
    <li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="3"></li>
  </ol>
  <div class="carousel-inner">
    <div class="item active">
      <img src="images/pic2.jpg" alt="First slide">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="carousel-caption">
          <h1>Corazon Dancers</h1>
          <p>Latin L.A. Salsa</p>
          <p><a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" href="#" role="button">Sign up today</a></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

```

<h2><a href="https://github.com/lgc13/LucasCosta_portfolio/tree/master/static_websites/RockinIt_project">2- Rockin' It project</a></h2>

<!-- Project BIO -->
This is a static website which displays some information about Rock n' Roll! By opening this website, a user can see information about Rock's history, some statistics of its genres, an embedded Youtube video, and some other references. This is one of the first projects that I made using HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap.

This application displays some of my skills with:

- Bootstrap
- Embedding videos onto HTML
- Div classes and Grid system
- Basic JavaScript concepts
- HTML and CSS

<img src="RockinIt_project/images/page2.png" width= 80% length= 80%>

<!-- Code explanation -->
For this website, I use a simple nav bar id from Bootstrap. This makes it very easy to have a well-aligned, colorful, and adjustable nav bar. I also use href links for each navbar list option, so that when clicked, the page will scroll down to find that specific area.


<!-- Code snippet -->

```html

<!--Navigation Bar holds Navigation Buttons -->
<div id="navbar">
	<div class="container">  <!-- container keeps everything aligned and centered no matter what the window size -->
		<ul id="menu">
			<!-- button class provides button-like appearance and scrolling javascript (see bottom of html code) -->
			<li><a href="#overview" class="button">Overview</a></li>
			<li><a href="#video" class="button">Video</a></li>
   		<li><a href="#discography" class="button">Discography</a></li>
		</ul>
	</div> <!-- end container -->
</div> <!-- end navbar -->

```
