# Corazon project

<!-- Project BIO -->
This is a static website that I created for a Salsa group that I was a member of while at FSU - Corazon Salsa Dancers. This website aims to show information about the group, such as their purpose, history, and contact information. Someone going on this website should also be able to see pictures, upcoming events, and information on how to join.

This application displays some of my skills with:

- Bootstrap features
- JavaScript
- Carousel Slideshow
- CSS classes and IDs
- HTML development

<!-- Code explanation -->
Bootstrap has a lot of nifty features, such a the grid system that allows me to organize my website with rows and columns within Divs. Another nice thing is the "carousel". Using some of their CSS and JS, I am able to easily create an ongoing carousel slideshow which displays any pictures and text that I input.

<!-- Code snippet -->
You can see that in this code snippet:

```html

<div id="myCarousel" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
  <!-- Indicators -->
  <ol class="carousel-indicators">
    <li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li>
    <li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="1"></li>
    <li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="2"></li>
    <li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="3"></li>
  </ol>
  <div class="carousel-inner">
    <div class="item active">
      <img src="images/pic2.jpg" alt="First slide">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="carousel-caption">
          <h1>Corazon Dancers</h1>
          <p>Latin L.A. Salsa</p>
          <p><a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" href="#" role="button">Sign up today</a></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

```
