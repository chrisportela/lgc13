 <p><strong>A Tour through Rock and Roll.</strong></p>
 
     <p>Rock has been such a grand part of music for most of our lives. It has through many ways, changed history. And although it is very popular, many are not aware of the fact that Rock actually originated from the soothing sounds of the blues and gospel music. YES REALLY!</p>
     <p>Talking about Rock in general is one thing. But are you aware of how many branches Rock deals out just on the "Alternate Rock" subgenre?</p>
     <p>There are probably more Rock subgenres than other regular genres all put together. Therefore we will try to specify on some of the main hits heard from the 80's, 90's and today such as Aerosmith, ACDC, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, among others.</p>
